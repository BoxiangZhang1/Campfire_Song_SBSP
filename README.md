# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I call this one, the campfire song song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum...
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
If you don't know the words, just hum along!
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
Now you've got it, you're doing great, just stay strong!
